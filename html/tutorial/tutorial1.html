%% tutorial 1: algebra and topology
% This package provides various algebraic and topologic functions. Our goal
% is to provide "engough" fundamental functions such that users can develop
% their own applications based on (only) this package. Performance is
% always in our mind when developing this package. To achieve best
% performance, vectorized operation is employed whenever possible.
% 
% adjacency matrix is widely used. Nonzero element in am indicates a link
% (edge) of the mesh. Likewise, nonzero element in amd indicates a link (halfedge)
% of the mesh. Additionally, am(i,j) == 2 means that edge(i,j) is an
% interior edge, while am(i,j) == 1 means edge(i,j) is an boundary edge,
% since boundary edge appears only used by one face and interior edge 
% shares by two faces.
% Since halfedge is unique, i.e., every halfedge belongs to a single face, 
% we store this connection between halfedge and face in amd. That is, 
% amd(i,j) = k means that halfedge(i,j) belongs to face k, or vice verse,
% face k has halfedge(i,j), or equivalently, face k has two vertex i and j
% and they are in ccw order.
[face,vertex] = read_off('face.off');
[am,amd] = compute_adjacency_matrix(face);
%%
% Now we show how we can make use of adjacency matrix.

% find edges of original mesh
[I,J,V] = find(am);    % all nonzero elements in am
ind = I<J;             % to avoid duplicity
edge = [I(ind),J(ind)];% done!

% find boundary edges
ind = I<J & V == 1;
% almost same with reslut of freeBoundary, except that bd2 is not in

% Computation on mesh is uausllay decomposed to faces or vertices, for
% example, calculate face area or vertex normal, discretize Laplace 
% operator or gradeint operator. Such computation usually needs
% neighbouring faces/vertices. 
% 
% There are two ways to do this. One natural way is first find neighbours 
% then do the computation. Now we compute one-ring area at each vertex,
% i.e., area of each vertex is the summation of area of its neighbour faces.

% find compute one-ring faces of vertex
[face,vertex] = read_off('bunny.off');
fa = face_area(face,vertex);
nv = size(vertex,1);
%%

% insteaf of using for loop to sum, we can use arrayfun, which is more efficient
vfr = compute_vertex_face_ring(face);
va = arrayfun(@(i) sum(fa(vfr{i})),1:nv);
%%
% We can also do it in a MUCH MORE efficent way. Since every halfedge is
% attached with a face, and we can easily access halfedges which start from 
% a vertex. Then the one-ring vertex area can be calculated in this way: 
% for every halfedge, associate it with area of the face that the halfedge 
% is attached to, then sum the area w.r.t. halfedge, which can be done by
